Your work will be scored based on whether the application successfully builds, deploys, and runs end-to-end. There is no opportunity to fix errors after submission.\n\nYour objective is to:\n1. Clone the repository\n2. Analyze the repository to understand the application(s) and discover all services and their dependencies\n3. Create Dockerfile(s) to containerize the application(s) - one per service if multiple services exist\n4. Create Kubernetes manifests (Deployments/StatefulSets, Services, Ingresses) to deploy the application(s) and all discovered dependencies\n\nWhen creating Dockerfile(s):\n- Identify all services in the repository (may be single-service or multi-service monorepo)\n- Create one Dockerfile per service\n- Use an appropriate base image for each application's language/framework\n- Copy necessary files and install dependencies\n- Expose the application port\n- Specify the command to run the application\n- If the application needs to run as non-root, add a USER directive, otherwise let it run as root (default)\n- For multi-service repos, place each Dockerfile in its service directory (e.g., backend/Dockerfile, frontend/Dockerfile)\n- IMPORTANT: When using build_context (e.g., \"frontend\"), all paths in the Dockerfile are relative to that directory. For example, if build_context is \"frontend\", then \"COPY package.json .\" copies from frontend/package.json, NOT from the repository root\n\nPython specific:\n- For Python applications: Check if the code uses relative imports (e.g., \"from . import models\"). If it does:\n  * For web frameworks (Flask/FastAPI/Django): Use a proper WSGI/ASGI server like uvicorn or gunicorn with module path syntax (e.g., \"uvicorn app.main:app\" or \"gunicorn app.main:app\")\n  * For scripts: Run as a module using \"python -m package.module\" instead of \"python file.py\"\n  * Ensure WORKDIR is set correctly so Python can find the package\n\nWhen creating Kubernetes manifests:\n- Create separate resources for each service (e.g., if there's a backend and frontend, create 2 Deployments and 2 Services)\n- For each stateless service: create a Deployment (use 1 replica by default) and a Service to expose it\n- For web-accessible services: create an Ingress with host: \"<repository-name>.{domain_suffix}\"\n  * IMPORTANT: The host must be lowercase and comply with RFC 1123 subdomain rules (only lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and dots)\n  * Convert repository name to lowercase before using it in the host (e.g., \"Math-PDF-Generator\" \u2192 \"math-pdf-generator\")\n- Set imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent (do NOT use \"Never\")\n- Include resource requests and limits for all containers\n- Add health checks if the service has a health endpoint\n- For security context: default to allowing root; only set runAsNonRoot/runAsUser when it is clear the image already uses a non-root user and does not need privileged ports\n- When in doubt about security settings, prioritize functionality and omit runAsNonRoot and runAsUser\n\nIMPORTANT - Discovering External Dependencies:\nYour key task is to actively discover what external services the application needs:\n- Analyze code, configuration files, environment variables, and connection strings\n- Look for database connections (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, etc.)\n- Look for cache/message queue usage (Redis, RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.)\n- Look for any other external services the application connects to\n- For each discovered dependency, create appropriate Kubernetes resources:\n  * StatefulSet for stateful services (databases, message queues)\n  * PersistentVolumeClaim for data persistence - use storageClassName: \"microk8s-hostpath\" or omit it entirely to use the default storage class\n  * Service to expose the dependency\n  * Secret for credentials\n  * ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration\n\nAfter generating all files, respond with a JSON object in this format:\n\n```json\n{{\n  \"docker_images\": [\n    {{\n      \"dockerfile_path\": \"backend/Dockerfile\",\n      \"image_tag\": \"backend\",\n      \"build_context\": \"backend\"\n    }},\n    {{\n      \"dockerfile_path\": \"frontend/Dockerfile\",\n      \"image_tag\": \"frontend\",\n      \"build_context\": \"frontend\"\n    }}\n  ],\n  \"kubernetes_files\": [\n    \"k8s/backend-deployment.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/backend-service.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/frontend-deployment.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/frontend-service.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/ingress.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/postgres-statefulset.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/postgres-service.yaml\",\n    \"k8s/postgres-secret.yaml\"\n  ],\n  \"test_endpoint\": \"/api/health\"\n}}\n```\n\nImportant notes for the output:\n- docker_images: Include one entry per service/Dockerfile.
